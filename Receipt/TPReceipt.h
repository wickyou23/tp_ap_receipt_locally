/*
https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ValidateLocally.html

To validate the receipt, perform the following tests, in order:
1.Locate the receipt.
- If no receipt is present, validation fails.
2. Verify that the receipt is properly signed by Apple.
- If it is not signed by Apple, validation fails.
3. Verify that the bundle identifier in the receipt matches a hard-coded constant containing the CFBundleIdentifier value you expect in the Info.plist file.
- If they do not match, validation fails.
4. Verify that the version identifier string in the receipt matches a hard-coded constant containing the CFBundleShortVersionString value (for macOS) or the CFBundleVersion value (for iOS) that you expect in the Info.plist file.
- If they do not match, validation fails.
5. Compute the hash of the GUID as described in Compute the Hash of the GUID.
- If the result does not match the hash in the receipt, validation fails.
